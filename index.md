# GitHub Global Campus is the Best
## and here's why
- You get to learn how to use GitHub, an industry leading tool in cloud-based version control.
- You can apply for the GitHub Student Pack if you're a student to access a ton of other resources to help you in your development life.
- There's a community of other students just like you ready to help you out when in need

I, for instance, am currently learning how to communicate with Markdown - a way to format text using a simple syntax. It's how I made this file!

Besides Markdown and GitHub, I am learning Python since I want to solve problems with the power of tech.
```py
# I'm craving for some pie. I went to a cafe and these are the flavours available:
pie = ["Apple Cinnamon Pie", "Blueberry Pie", "Strawberry Pie"]

# I think I'll have the last flavour
def serve_pie(flavours: list):
  if len(pie) > 0:
    served_pie = pop(flavours)
  return served_pie

# Bon Apetit!
serve_pie(pie)
```
ps: I haven't tested this code to see if it actually works.
